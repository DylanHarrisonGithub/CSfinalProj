# CSfinalProj
CSfinalProj is web-based, two player game of billiards developed in the Google App Engine framework for one of my Computer Science
classes. The project consists of a server-side Python application and an HTML/JavaScript frontend.
Read more about this project on my blog, [https://dylansamcsblog.wordpress.com/](https://dylansamcsblog.wordpress.com/2017/04/15/various-2d-game-and-physics-derivations/).

You can also play this game at [http://our-mediator-166519.appspot.com/](http://our-mediator-166519.appspot.com/). Since it
is a two player only game, it will likely be necessary to open the url twice, in two seperate browser tabs, and play against yourself.
